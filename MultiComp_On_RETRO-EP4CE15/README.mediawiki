== Land Boards RETRO-EP4 FPGA Retro-Computer Board ==

* These are the VHDL files for our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RETRO-EP4CE15 RETRO-EP4CE15].
** This card presents a hardware implementation of [http://searle.x10host.com/Multicomp/index.html Grant Searle's Multicomp] Retro-Computer.
** Grant's projects re-create late 1970's and early 1980's era vintage computers using inexpensive FPGA cards.
* Our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RetroComputers RetroComputing Wiki page is here].

== RRETRO-EP4CE15 Features ==

* Geared towards Retro-Computing
** Grant Searle's [http://searle.x10host.com/Multicomp/index.html Multicomp project] as an example
** Uses [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=QMTECH_EP4CE15_FPGA_Card QMTECH EP4CE15 FPGA Card]
* 512 KB of fast SRAM
** Access more than 64KB from 8-bit microprocessors by using a banking/mapping register inside the FPGA
* I/O Connectivity
** PS/2 keyboard connector
** VGA connector
** FTDI USB to serial
** VGA, PS/2, and Serial I/O connections on a single edge
* 5V power connector (on rear edge)
* SD Card slot
** SD card mounts from rear bottom of the board

=== Blink_LED - Tested/Works ===

* Blink the (4) LEDs on the FPGA card plus an external LED
* Uses a large internal counter to divide down the 50 MHz clock rate

== Land Boards - Other FPGA Projects ==

These different folders reflect the hardware that we have got Multicomp running on. Some of these designs are Land Boards and others are based on commercial products.

* [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=EP2C5-DB Land Boards EP2C5-DB FPGA Retro-Computer card]
** Duplicates Grant's design down to the pin maps

** Adds extra logic and RAM resources beyond the EP2C5 FPGA
*** Can do up to 16K of Internal SRAM
** [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Retro-Computer_Map_EP2_to_EP4_card Wiring is here]
* [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=Cyclone_IV_FPGA_EP4CE6E22C8N_Development_Board_USB_V2 Purchased EP4 FPGA card]
** Includes VGA, PS/2 and USB-Serial converter
** Other I/O is serious limitation but a 16K retro machine without SD Card storage can easily be built

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
