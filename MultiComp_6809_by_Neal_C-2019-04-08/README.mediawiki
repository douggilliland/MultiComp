== Neal Crook's multicomp6809 Retrocomputer ==

These are the Neals Crook's VHDL files for [http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html which built on Grant Searle's Multicomp] Retro-Computer. Grant's projects re-create late 1970's and early 1980's era vintage computers using inexpensive FPGA cards. Neal put a lot of effort into improving the M6809 implementation as well as some of the other core parts.

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
