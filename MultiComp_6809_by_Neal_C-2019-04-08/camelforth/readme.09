       CAMELFORTH FOR THE 6809 - ALPHA TEST VERSION - 7 MAY 1995
       =========================================================

This is an ALPHA TEST version of CamelForth/09, an ANSI Standard Forth
for the Motorola 6809 microprocessor.  This means that, although I have
tested the bulk of this code for correct functioning, you ARE LIKELY to
discover bugs.  I'd appreciate hearing of any such, via email at
bj@camelforth.com

I'll also answer questions and try to solve problems.

       ========== RECOMPILING THE CAMELFORTH/09 KERNEL ==========

CamelForth/09 is supplied as source code, and is compiled with a Forth
metacompiler, Chromium 2.  This compiler, and the corresponding 6809
cross-assembler, are distributed with CamelForth/09.  To run this
compiler you must have Laxen & Perry F83 for the IBM PC (available from
the Forth Interest Group, many IBM PC shareware distributors, or by
download from GEnie).

To compile CamelForth/09, put CHROMIUM.SCR and F83.COM in your working
directory, and then type the two commands

        F83 CHROMIUM.SCR
        1 LOAD

This will start F83, load the compiler, compile the 6809 kernel, and
save the result to an Intel hex file 6809.HEX.  This file can be
downloaded to an EPROM emulator or burned into an EPROM.

The Chromium compiler should work with any version of F83 (such as for
the Atari ST or for CP/M)...but this has not yet been tested.
Unfortunately, the hex file utility is specific to the IBM PC, and must
be rewritten for any other computer system.

                ========== MEMORY AND I/O MAP ==========

CamelForth is distributed to run on the ScroungeMaster II 6809 board, as
described in The Computer Journal [see below].  The program compiles to
run in ROM at address E000 hex, allowing the use of either an 8K (2764),
16K (27128), or 32K (27256) EPROM.  CamelForth's initialization code
will map the ScroungeMaster RAM to the address space 0000-7BFF hex, and
the on-board I/O to the space 7C00-7FFF hex.  As distributed, CamelForth
only uses RAM locations 6000-7BFF hex, allowing the use of either an 8K
(6264), 32K (62256), or 128K (628128) static RAM.

        FFF0 +--------------------+
             | 6809 reset vectors |
        FFFF +--------------------+

This memory map is controlled by screen 61 of the CHROMIUM.SCR file:

        HEX 0E000 FFFF DICTIONARY ROM   ROM    ( A )
            7A00  EQU UP-INIT                  ( B )
            7A    EQU UP-INIT-HI               ( C )
            6000  EQU DP-INIT                  ( D )

Line A specifies the lower and upper ROM limits.  Thus, to use a full
32K ROM, you would change '0E000' to '8000'.  Do not change the 'FFFF'
limit, since the reset vectors must be compiled.

Lines B and C control the location of the RAM data area.  This area
extends from 80h bytes before UP-INIT, to 200h bytes after (7980h to
7C00h in this example).  You may move these by changing UP-INIT,
provided that UP-INIT is always on a 256-byte boundary (i.e., has the
value xx00 hex), and provided that you change Line C to match Line B
(i.e., the corresponding value xx hex).

Line D controls the starting location of the RAM dictionary.  This is
where the CamelForth compiler/interpreter adds new Forth words.  This
can be changed to any RAM address.  Thus to use a full 32K RAM you could
change this to '0000'.

I recommend that you leave the I/O mapping alone (controlled by the 6809
initialization code in screen 118).  Its location at 7C00h gives the
largest contiguous RAM space if 32K or 128K RAMs are used.  If you are
not using a ScroungeMaster II, you should delete this memory mapping
code, and you should adjust the CamelForth memory map to suit your
hardware.  (You will also need to change the serial I/O initialization,
and rewrite the words KEY KEY? and EMIT.)

      ========== UPLOADING A FORTH PROGRAM TO THE 6809 ==========

On the ScroungeMaster II, CamelForth uses serial port A (port A of the
first Zilog 8530 SCC, U10). With a 4 MHz crystal oscillator, this port
will be set to 4800 baud; with an 8 MHz crystal, 9600 baud.

You can communicate with the 6809 using a terminal program such as
Procomm.  You can type new words from the keyboard, test them as they
are defined, and re-define them to make changes.  Or you can edit an
ASCII text file, and upload this file from the PC to the 6809.

A line of Forth code takes an appreciable fraction of a second to
compile, so you can't send it "full blast" at 4800 or 9600 baud.
Instead, set Procomm's ASCII Transfer "pace character" to 10 decimal
(line feed).  CamelForth will not send the CR/LF pair until it has
finished processing the line, so you can use LF as a synchronization
character.  You should also set Procomm to strip LF characters from the
uploaded file.  (Other terminal programs should have similar options.)
Be sure that no line in your file exceeds 80 characters.

    ========== ADDING YOUR FORTH CODE TO THE PROM KERNEL ==========

If you want to burn your program into PROM, you can add it to the kernel
source code in CHROMIUM.SCR.  I recommend you use a contiguous set of
screens for your source code, and add them as a separate line to screen
1 (the master load screen), immediately after the line

        DECIMAL 61 119 THRU

which loads the 6809 Forth kernel.  The CHROMIUM.SCR file contains:

          0 +---------------+   120 +---------------+
            |  metacompiler |       |   "shadow"    |
            |  source code  |       | documentation |
         30 +---------------+   150 +---------------+
            | 6809 assembler|       |               |
         45 +---------------+       |    unused     |
            |    unused     |       |               |
            |               |   176 +---------------+
         60 +---------------+       |     6809      |
            |   6809 Forth  |       |    binary     |
            |  source code  |       |     image     |
        119 +---------------+   239 +---------------+

You may use screens 45-59, and 150-175, for your source code.  Do NOT
use screens 176-239, even if they appear empty.  These 64 screens hold a
copy of the 64K binary image being generated by the metacompiler, and a
mistake in the source code could corrupt any of these screens.

The metacompiler will accept "normal-looking" Forth code: colon
definitions, CODE definitions, VARIABLEs, CONSTANTs, CREATEs, ALLOTs,
etc. -- look at the CamelForth source code for examples.  Vocabularies
are not yet supported.  IMMEDIATE words (e.g. CASE) and defining words
(CREATE..DOES>) can be metacompiled, but require special metacompiler
phrases to be added to your source code.  If you are not familiar with
Forth metacompilers, I suggest you refrain from using these features
until the next release of the Chromium metacompiler.
