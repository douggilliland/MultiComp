== land-boards FPGA Multicomp Retro-Computers ==

* These files are the builds we have done of [http://searle.hostei.com/grant/Multicomp/index.html Grant Searle's Multicomp] Retro-Computer.
** Grant's projects re-create 1970's and 1980's vintage computers using recent (or relatively recent) inexpensive FPGA cards.
* We down-selected some of the Multicomp designs and checked [our https://github.com/douggilliland/Retro-Computers/tree/master/FPGA%20Retro%20Computers/MultiComp%20Archives FPGA archives here]
* Our [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=RetroComputing RetroComputing Wiki page] for these projects is here].

=== Daughtercard for Multicomp ===

* We created this [http://land-boards.com/blwiki/index.php?title=EP2C5-DB EP2C5-DB FPGA Retro-Computer Daughter card] to connect to the FPGA and provide all of the I/O that is needed.

* Supports all of the Multicomputer build features
** VGA or Composite Video Output
** PS/2 keyboard Input
** Two Serial Ports
** 64K SRAM
** SD Card (1 GB or 2 GB)

== Tested Builds ==

* [http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=2858 Grant's 2012 Multicomp Announcement] - lists the builds he had tested at the time
* We have built ourselves and tested all of the below archives.

* Our [https://github.com/douggilliland/MultiComp other builds are located here].
** Some have not been shown to work.
** Others work but have not been tested sufficiently to load here.
** We have had trouble with getting the 6809 with external RAM to work.

== Ownership ==

* Some of these files such as FPGA designs and software libraries were created by others.
** There may be newer versions of these libraries "out there".
** Some libraries even have the same names but don't work the same.
* Many of these files were created by me based on the work of others.

=== Warning ===

* Use at your own risk.
** If you brick your part or it melt to a puddle, it's on you not me.
