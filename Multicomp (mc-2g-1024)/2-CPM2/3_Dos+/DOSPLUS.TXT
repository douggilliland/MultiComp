DOS+  is  a  complete  replacement system  for  CPM2.2  (Copyright  Digital
Research).    DOS+  provides  many  CPM3  features,   and  several   unique
capabilities.   It also supplies many ZCPR features,  without requiring any
extra memory assignments.  DOS+ operates on Z80 CPUs only.

                        Features Added over CPM2.2
                        ==========================

1.   DOS+  will  process files of up to 262,143 records  (like  CPM3),
     i.e. of over 3 megabytes.

2.   DOS+ allows for time-stamping of all files, for creation, modify,
     and access.   Creation records only the date,  others record both
     date and time.  DOS+ may be configured to NOT do access stamping,
     thus  allowing for the use of write-protected disks.   Note  that
     the time stamps are NOT identical with CPM3 (DOS+ maintains three
     values), but are compatible in that the file system will function
     correctly  under either CPM2 or CPM3.   Time stamping occurs only
     on drives with the correctly formatted directory (see INITDIR.COM
     to  initialize disks with/or without files already stored),  when
     the timer operation is enabled.   If the file is marked read-only
     no access time will be  maintained.   The FDATE utility acts much
     like DIR (except that some file  or drive specification  must  be
     entered) to show the stored time stamps.   Dates are shown in ISO
     standard format (year/month/day).

3.   DOS+  has compatible DCIO (function 6,  direct console  i/o)  and
     other  console  calls.   DCIO  can now return a  null,  by  first
     checking  status (argument 0fdh in register e).   Buffered  input
     characters will be available to the application with mixed calls.
     DCIO with argument (in E register) 0fdh performs wait_for_console
     input (as does CPM3), and with argument 0fch returns a look-ahead
     console character, i.e.  the  value which will be accessed by the
     next console input call (provided the console status is 'ready').
     For this argument register H (and register B) returns the current
     console column,  as recorded by DOS+.   In addition,  if the bios
     supports it, this call (function 6,  argument less than 0fch  for
     direct console output) returns the current screen x-y position as
     a value in hl.  This is whatever value the bios returns in hl. As
     a standard,  this should be the  line in h,  and the column in l,
     each with an offset of 020h added. i.e. 02020h is 0,0, top left.

4.   DOS+ will always pause (on console output) when a CTL-S (DC3)  is
     entered,  EXCEPT  for DCIO calls.   Thus an accidental  keystroke
     will no longer leave a program running indefinitely.   However an
     interrupt driven bios with its own buffer may delay the pause.

5.   DOS+ can be interrupted at any BDOS call (if so configured).  The
     "break"  key is configurable (default a NUL,  i.e.  CTL-@ on most
     systems).   If enabled,  DCIO calls can be separately enabled  or
     disabled.   When a "break" occurs the question "Resume (y/N)?" is
     asked,  and  a "y" (or "Y") will resume the application  program.
     Any other key aborts to a  warm  boot.   If  breaks  are disabled
     the CTL-C character will not abort the application program.  This
     allows programs to ensure they retain control.

6.   DOS+  errors show the calling function,  and the file name (if  a
     file  is involved).   All such errors other than disk i/o errors,
     exit to a warm boot when a <cr> is entered.   For disk i/o errors 
     options to retry, ignore, or abort are available.  Provisions are
     made for application programs to intercept and handle any errors.

7.   DOS+ implements the CPM3 calls 104 and 105 (set/get time), when a
     suitable  timer mechanism is configured.   This mechanism may  be
     either  a reserved memory area (5 bytes) to hold the time,  or  a
     routine may be called (which should return such a pointer).   The
     DE register points to the application array (see definition below
     of the array) which is filled (1st 4 bytes) on call 105  (seconds
     are returned in the A register), or used to set (call 104),  when
     the system seconds value is forced to 0.

8.   DOS+ setuser call (32 = 020h) echoes the user # set.

9.   DOS+ implements a search path, stored in a configurable dedicated
     memory  area.   TO USE the bios MUST initialize the path at power
     on (cold-boot).   A single 0 byte at the head of the path  string
     suffices.    The   path  (like  ZCPR)  consists  of  byte  pairs,
     specifying  drive  and user,  with '$' specifying  the  defaults.
     Unlike  ZCPR, the user value specifies under which user the drive
     search will be made, and only  the current user area is searched.
     Thus  "A$" causes the A drive to be searched on all  user  areas,
     and  "B3C2" causes the B drive search under user 3,  C under user
     2,  etc.  Thus the path string can be thought of as an intermixed
     set of paths for the various user areas.   The default drive will
     not  be searched twice.   The path must be terminated with a zero
     byte.  The path applies only when a file is opened with a default
     drive specification,  and if a path entry is applied the  callers
     FCB is marked with the actual drive on which the file was  found.
     The current default drive is always searched first.

10.  DOS+ makes all $SYS files,  on user area 0,  visible to all users
     for read.  They may not be written to, nor erased from other user
     areas.  Thus common utilities and files can be made public.   All
     $SYS files are treated as read-only, however they may  be  erased
     from their "home" user area.

11.  DOS+  maintains  the $ARC bit,  resetting it whenever a  file  is
     modified.  This can co-operate with archiving programs.  This can
     fail  if  a program performs random writes and fails to close the
     file.

12.  DOS+ can maintain an exact byte count for a file,  using the same
     methods  as CPM3.   When a file is opened,  if the current record
     byte (offset 32 = 020h in the FCB) is set to 0ffh,  the count  of
     unused  bytes  in the last record will be  returned  there.   The
     count  may be set with function call 30 (set file attributes)  by
     setting  the F6 (interface attribute) bit,  and placing the count
     in  the  current  record  byte.   This  count  is  normally  zero
     (indicating no unused bytes), and can range up to 07fh = 127.  F6
     interface bit will be reset when function 30 is complete.

13.  DOS+  scans user area 0 for any file names beginning with '$'  on
     the disk reset call (not the current user, as in CPM2).  This co-
     operates with CCP+,  JOB,  and other utilities so that batch jobs
     can  switch  user areas and continue  functioning.   It  is  only
     compatible with SUBMIT and earlier versions of JOB, //IF, //SKIP,
     ZCPR, etc. when the default user is 0.

14.  Like  CPM3,  the  F5  thru  F8 attribute bits  are  reserved  for
     internal and interface use.  F1 thru F4 are available.

15.  DOS+  returns version number 2.5,  thus avoiding  confusion  with
     CPM3,  and signalling compatibility with CPM2.2.   Later releases
     will return 2.6 up, but less than 3.0.   The  "compatibility bit"
     (see below) can force a 2.2 return value.

16.  DOS+ maintains the entry jump, and the error vectors, in the same
     locations  as  CPM2.2,   for  compatibility  with  programs  that
     intercept errors or follow an RSX chain to find the BDOS module.

17.  DOS+ call #210 (0d2h), with suitable arguments in the E register,
     returns system information.  For version 2.5, the arguments are:
               0      Return base address for BDOS module.
                      Used for dynamic reconfiguration.
               1      Return the current DMA setting.
               2.     Flush any console input pending, emptying
                      all buffers.  Returns 0.
               3.     Returns list device status (ready/not ready)
               4.     Returns punch   "     "          "
               5      Returns reader  "     "          "
     Arguments 3 thru 5 represent ready as 0ffh,  not ready as 0.   If
     no  custom installation for  punch/reader device status  has been
     made (see -INSTALL.DOC) their status  is returned 0  (not ready). 
     Other arguments return 0.

18.  DOS+ call #211 (0d3h) outputs the value in the DE register as  an
     unsigned 16  bit value,  in decimal,  to the console with leading
     zero suppression.

19.  DOS+ can be set in "compatibility" mode, which forces the version
     number call (12 = 0ch) to return 2.2, and eliminates the 0fch and
     0fdh arguments from the DCIO call (#6). This avoids most problems
     with existing programs.

20.  DOS+ maintains  the  "list echo" flag as the 1 (lsb)  bit  in the
     option byte at offset 18h (from the start of BDOS).   This allows
     application programs to dynamically control such echos as well as
     other features (such as breaks, access time stamping, etc).  Call
     #210 with a 0 argument (above) returns a pointer to this area.


                              C C P +  system
                              ===============

CCP+  replaces  the CPM2 CCP and ZCPR.   It is  designed  for  installation
without re-assembly,  supports DU addressing,  wheel byte, du restrictions,
and  is generally suitable for both general use and RCPM use.   CCP+ may be
used  with standard CPM2.2 if desired.   It is incorporated in the  MOVDOS+
DOS+  installation program,  with search options set for use of DOS+ paths.
For details on installation options, read -INSTALL.DOS.

The CPM "user" command is eliminated,  in favor of DU addressing.  To login
to drive b,  user 3,  enter "b3:" for example.   To login to user area 2 on
the current drive, enter "2:", etc.  ":" alone as a du specification stands
for all defaults.

1.   DIR  command accepts options "s" (for system files also) and  "o"
     (for  only  system  files)  following  the  file   specification.
     Multiple dir arguments may be entered,  using the ";" to separate
     the sections.  "dir a:;b: o" shows a:, and system files on b:. DU
     specification may be used.   Areas visible may be different under
     wheel and non-wheel states.  The number of entries shown per line
     can be configured at installation time.

2.   The SAVE size argument may have a "+" appended,  to save an extra
     1/2  page (or single record).   "SAVE 3 blah" keeps a 3 page =  6
     record  file,  while "SAVE 3+ blah" keeps a 3 1/2 page = 7 record
     file.  0+ saves 1 record only.

3.   GO command re-executes whatever program is already loaded.   Such
     a program should be self-initializing.

4.   KILL command halts any executing batch job (created by SUBMIT  or
     JOB).   It is intended for conditional use in batch jobs, guarded
     by //IF statements.

5.   CAPS command is a toggle,  and allows lower case command lines to
     be passed to applications.   When executed it reports the current
     status.   This  is useful for command line driven  programs  that
     need lower case arguments (such as Software Tools TRANSLIT).

6.   Extra  blanks are generally acceptable in command lines,  but may
     create  problems when command lines are passed  to  applications.
     Thus  "dir  a:" and "dir       a:" are equivalent.   This  avoids
     nuisance errors.

7.   A configurable option allows the automatic search of A:  whenever
     the file for a transient (.COM) or TYPE command is not found. For
     DOS+ this is normally disabled,  and the path is used.   For CPM2
     this provides most of the abilities of a path.

8.   Whenever a transient application is not found,  the file CCPXTEND
     (.SYS)  is  automatically loaded and passed the complete  command
     line.  This  implements  further searches,  in particular  for  a
     component of COMMAND.LBR,  and can continue to other systems when
     failure  occurs (such as RUNPCD for Pascal,  or MBASIC for  basic
     programs,  or JOB for automatic batch execution).   See  CCPXTEND
     documentation.

9.   Drives  accessible  can  be  configured,  with  individual  drive
     selection,  for  both  wheel and non-wheel status.   This  avoids
     drive  selection error aborts on typing  errors.   Similarly  the
     maximum user areas are configurable.

10.  Individual  commands may be disabled under non-wheel  conditions.
     Any such will attempt to access a transient.  If prefixed by a DU
     specification  any  built-in  name may access a  transient  (i.e.
     "a:dir" will attempt to run a:dir.com,   while "dir" will execute
     the built-in command).

11.  The $$$.SUB file is always on drive A, user 0.   A submit job may
     include commands  to change user areas  and continue functioning.
     The versions of JOB, //IF, //SKIP, XJOB included follow this con-
     vention.   The KILL command avoids creating long  instructions to
     abort jobs when an error is detected.


                      CCPXTEND.SYS usage (automatic)
                      ==============================

This is intended to eliminate any syntactical difference between  execution
of  programs stored in libraries,  and those that reside as files on  disk.
The  available  program names will not appear in a DIR listing (but can  be
shown by SD, a public domain program).


Use  with  CCP+ results in the following syntax at the CCP level.

B>name [command tail]               executes name as a .COM on any
                                    drive specified in the path, or
                                    as a component of COMMAND.LBR
                                    on any drive on the path.

B>-d: name [command tail]           Executes name as a component
                                    of d:COMMAND.LBR only.

B>-lbrname name [command tail]      Executes name as a component of
                                    lbrname.LBR on drives on the path.

B>-d:lbrname name [command tail]    Executes name as a component of
                                    d:lbrname.LBR only

B>-d:lbrname.ext name [command tail] Executes name as a component
                                    of d:lbrname.ext only.

Overall, the search path for a command without disk spec. is:
      1. default drive, current user (normal CPM stops here)
      2. path drives, current user
      3. default drive, current user, in COMMAND.LBR
      4. path drives, current user, in COMMAND.LBR
      5. Whatever final system is patched into CCPXTEND.SYS

(remembering that $SYS files on user area 0 are available at each step)

NOTE that if a file -nnn.COM exists it can be executed by CCP+ before  this
CCPXTEND system is reached.

CAVEAT:  the  normal SYSGEN program expects to be loaded without disturbing
memory  from 0900h up through about 237fh (varies with system).   Even  the
0900h  may be invalid for some systems (this is where the  bootstrap  image
goes).   To  use SYSGEN from COMMAND.LBR without taking special precautions
(for altering systems,  e.g. installing CCP+) this program must not disturb
this area. This version (LRUN 2.0.4 or CCPXTEND 1.4) does not disturb 0880h
up, except for the 128 bytes below the CCP.

My  personal  usage is to install virtually all utilities  in  COMMAND.LBR,
because my system uses a minimun disk allocation of 2k bytes.  Thus, on the
average,  each  installed program saves 1k bytes of disk space,  and  small
programs even more.  The following should NOT be installed in libraries:

        WordStar        because the "Run" command within WordStar
                        must be able to find the file to reload.
                        If you never use this command WordStar may
                        be installed in a library.
        WSxxx.OVR       WordStar cannot find its overlays in a
                        library.
        CCPXTEND.SYS    This program itself MUST be directly
                        available.

and, where my Pascal system is installed:

        PASCALP.PCD     needs to be available as a file for TUNE
                        to set it's code versus data space usage.
                        If you never compile large programs and
                        want to leave it at some setting, go ahead
                        and install it in PCDS.LBR.  RUNPCD has a
                        build in library search.

In  general it is useless to install a program that takes an exact multiple
of the disk allocation unit, except to conserve on directory entries.

Using these techniques my normal system disk (390k,  with 64 max  directory
entries)  holds  about  110  programs,  and uses only  about  20  directory
entries.  LRUN is constructed as an "ALIAS" entry for CCPXTEND (or you  may
consider it the reverse if you prefer).  I have a compiler, 4 assemblers, 3
linkers,  editor, BBS system, modem program, foreign disk drivers, spooler,
unspooler,  PCD interpreter,  batch system with conditionals, find and sort
utilities,  library  utilities,  squeeze/unsqueezers,  cross-referance  for
Pascal,  Zilog,  Intel  8080,  8086 assemblers,  and much more  immediately
available.  I virtually never have to change the system disk.


                        JOB (v. 1.5) Documentation
                        ==========================

JOB  is an improved submit facility for CP/m systems,  evolved from  public
domain SUPERSUB by Ron Fowler.  JOB is copyright (c) 1983, 1984, 1986 by:

     C.B. Falconer,  680 Hartford Tpk, Hamden, CT 06517. (203) 281-1438

JOB may be executed interactively (by "job /") or completely from  the com-
mand line (by "job / instruction").  Entering "JOB" with no parameters will
give a short summary. 

JOB allows parameters to be terminated by commas,  thus a pair (i.e.  ",,")
can  specify  a  null parameter.  In addition,  parameters can  be  "quoted
strings", to allow any input whatsoever. In a quoted string a quote must be
represented  by two quotes.  JOB also accepts empty input lines  (e.g.  PIP
exit command).

JOB creates the $$$.SUB file on drive A,  (user 0 as of JOB15) and thus can
be executed with any setting of the default drive. In addition JOB searches
both the default and A drives for the .JOB file when no drive is  specified
in  the  command  line,  and (ver 1.4) if no .JOB file has yet  been  found
searches default and system disks for a component of JOBS.LBR file.

Thus  a  set of small .JOB files can be packed into JOBS.LBR  and  executed
directly.  When many .JOB files are used this can significantly reduce disk
storage

An  initial line in the .JOB file beginning with ";;"  (double  semi-colon)
signifies that the line specifies a default set of parameters ($0 thru $9).
These  are  only  used  when the execution command  line  does  not  supply
parameters.

JOB does not arbitrarily upshift anything,  however an unmodified CCP  will
probably upshift all input lines. CCP+ can be set to avoid this upshifting.

JOB  will accept most files created for SUBMIT,  unless supplied parameters
include commas and quotes.  Since the reverse is not true JOB expects  its'
input files to be of type .JOB.

JOB15  up is organized to co-operate with CCP+/DOS+ and execute  jobs  thru
changes in user number.

A  test file to demonstrate JOB parameter handling appears below (note null
line, and use of initial ";" so that lines are comments to CCP+):

     ;;testingjob parm1, "parm2",, parm4 parm5, ," parm ""7"", "
     ; null defaults for parm3, parm6, parm8, parm9
     ;$1;

     ;$2;
     ;$3,$4,$5,$6;
     ;$7;
     ;$8;
     ;$9;
     ;$0; <<end of test file>>

try A>JOB TESTJOB
                      where testjob is the above file from the ";;"
This simply shows a set of comment commands on the console.


                       Conditional batch operations
                       ============================

These  are  handled by //IF and //SKIP programs,  which are  documented  in
IFSKIP.DOC (.DZC) separate file.  When combined with the facilities of JOB,
XJOB, CCP+, and DOS+ an extremely powerful batch capability results.


                               DDTZ debugger
                               =============

DDTZ is documented in the separate file DDTZ.DOC (.DZC)


                                 Utilities
                                 =========

All utilities give a short synopsis of their commands when executed with no
parameters, or with '?' parameter. MOVDOS+, //IF and //SKIP are exceptions.


INITDIR  allows re-organization of existing disks (or hard drives) for time
stamping.  Files and directories are preserved.  Directories are sorted.

FDATE allows examination of file time stamps, similar to DIR.

MOVDOS+ allows generation of various sized system images. See -INSTALL.DOS.

JOB, //IF, and //SKIP are discussed above.  XJOB replaces XSUB and is docu-
mented in a separate file, and makes programmed console input feasible.

ENSPOOL (ENSPOL10) allows all  lister output  to be spooled  to a specified
disk file.  To initialize do "enspool filename.typ".  Output echoed  to the
list device (by CTL-P) will not be spooled, nor will output via direct bios
calls.  ENSPOOL is removed by executing it again.   Note that until this is
done the output file is open, and the appropriate disk must NOT be changed.

UNSPOOL (UNSPOL42) unspools a disk file to the list device.   It is started
by "unspool filename.typ".

CCPXTEND.SYS is necessary for automatic access to files in COMMAND.LBR.

SETFLAGS allows dynamic re-configuration of  some DOS+ parameters,  in par-
ticular use of breaks, file access time stamping, and  compatibility  mode.
Executing SETFLAGS with no parameters shows the command syntax.   When SET-
FLAGS completes it does not reboot, so that the altered configuration  will
be in effect for the next program run.   Unless RSX's  are  mounted  (which
includes ENSPOOL and UNSPOOL) the next reboot will reset the configuration.

FCOPY copies files across user areas.  Unlike PIP it purges the destination
file first, allowing copying to full disks.  However disk failures can then
lose a file.  The default destination name is the source name if on a diff-
erent drive or user (or both).  -v flag causes verification.

FDIFF does a binary comparison between files.  The default "destination" is
the "source" name, on a different drive or user (or both).

TIME allows setting and  interrogation of  the system time.   Note that the
timer provisions are usable without any real-time-clock, by manual  setting
of the timer.  "time ?" gives help,  "time" reports,  "time yy/mm/dd hh-mm"
sets the system time.  Note use of ISO standard date format,  and that "hh"
is 24 hour (0..23) time.  Punctuate as shown.

The timer string and routine
============================

The timer address should point to a byte array, where

       byte 0 = low byte  } of DR format date, an integer count of
       byte 1 = high byte } days since 78/1/1   (78/1/1 = 1)
       byte 2 = hour, 0..23 (in BCD)
       byte 3 = minute, 0..59 (in BCD)
       byte 4 = second, 0..59 (in BCD).

If the timer address is a routine it should return hl a pointer to the
above array.  If the (bc) register is non zero on entry the time is to
be set, and the bc register points to the array to  set (4 bytes only,
the seconds byte should be set to zero).
